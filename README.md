# XML DTD

DTD stands for Document Type Definition. A DTD defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document. A "Valid" XML document is "Well Formed", as well as it conforms to the rules of a DTD.

The files [example.xml](example.xml) and [example1.xml](example1.xml) contain example XML data and DTD declaration. The documents can be validated using at https://www.xmlvalidation.com/
